"],["overview.html", "Chapter 2 Overview", " Chapter 2 Overview This book is targeted towards people who are teaching a course or workshop on AnVIL. You will find here: Overview – Design philosophy and goals for this guide - is this a good fit for your class? What should you know before you start? Account Setup – Step-by-step instructions to create your first accounts on AnVIL and create your first class Workspace Developing Content – Additional tools to help you customize your class Workspace Class Setup – Step-by-step instructions to help you add students into a class on AnVIL Class Ending – Best practices for finishing your course cleanly and minimizing costs Student Account Setup – Step-by-step account set up for students using AnVIL in your class 2.0.1 Goals for This Guide 2.0.2 Design Philosophy This guide provides an opinionated walkthrough on how to set up AnVIL for your class. These step-by-step instructions take instructors that are completely new to the AnVIL through account setup to the point where you can feel comfortable hosting a class from start-to-finish on AnVIL. Following the recommendations in this guide will help you minimize expenses, develop content programmatically, track individual student expenses, and stop billing expenses from accruing once the class is complete. In support of these goals we have made the following design decisions: ACCOUNT SETUP Sign up for a personal Google Cloud Account, where you can get started by claiming $300 free Google credits. CONTENT DEVELOPING Include version control and visibility of course content by using GitHub. This will allow you to add content programmatically, keep track of changes, and share your content with others outside of AnVIL. CLASS SETUP Create a separate Google Billing Account for each class. This will allow you to easily shut down expenses at the end of the class. Choose one funding source per class (for example, the STRIDES Program). Create separate Terra Billing Projects for each student. This will allow you to monitor billing expenses closely and work with students to build best computing practices. 2.0.3 Before You Start You will need a credit card or bank account to activate your free trial and get started. Don’t worry! You won’t be billed until you explicitly turn on automatic billing, but payment information is needed for verification purposes. Before setting up billing yourself, you may want to check with your institutional procurement office and see if they have a preferred account set-up method with Google (such as a third party reseller or an existing account). "],["account-setup.html", "Chapter 3 Account Setup 3.1 Overview of Account Setup 3.2 Step 1: Create a Google Account 3.3 Step 2: Sign in to Terra", " Chapter 3 Account Setup 3.1 Overview of Account Setup AnVIL uses Terra to run analyses. Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, so you’ll pay for all storage and analysis costs through a Google account linked to Terra. The costs are the standard Google Cloud Platform fees for storing and moving data as well as executing an analysis. These costs are passed along through Terra without any markup. 3.2 Step 1: Create a Google Account Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, so you will need a (free) Google account which will allow you to access the Terra platform to manage students and in-class analyses. Your Google account will also (1) allow you to manage billing yourself or (2) allow a Program Manager to do so on your behalf. If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, create one now. Otherwise, please use a Gmail account you have already set up. If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow these instructions. 3.3 Step 2: Sign in to Terra You need to sign into Terra to allow Billing Project managers to add you to projects and/or Workspaces. Launch Terra, and you should be prompted to sign in with your Google account. You can always access Terra by going to anvil.terra.bio, or by clicking the link on the AnVIL home page. "],["developing-content.html", "Chapter 4 Developing Content 4.1 Overview of Developing Content 4.2 Set Up AnVILPublish on AnVIL 4.3 Create Workspace Structure 4.4 Update Dashboard 4.5 Post Jupyter Notebook 4.6 Push Changes to GitHub", " Chapter 4 Developing Content 4.1 Overview of Developing Content This chapter will show you how to publish a Workspace on AnVIL using RStudio. Publishing Workspaces programmatically makes it easier to incorporate version control (e.g., using git) and ensures that all of your notebook files end up in the Workspace. Much of the information in this section comes from the AnVILPublish vignette, which can serve as an additional reference. 4.1.1 Before You Start You need to set up Billing. This includes your Google Billing Account and Terra Billing Project. Take note of your Terra Billing Project name. Create your first Workspace. A first Workspace is needed to launch RStudio, but after that, all Workspaces can be made programmatically from within other Workspaces. Launch RStudio using the Community-Maintained RStudio Environment. This requires you to be familiar with RStudio on AnVIL. 4.2 Set Up AnVILPublish on AnVIL 4.2.1 Install AnVILPublish Install AnVIL and AnVILPublish. Don’t worry about loading it for now. Tip: hover over the top-right corner of the box below to copy the code. BiocManager::install(&quot;AnVIL&quot;) AnVIL::install(&quot;AnVILPublish&quot;) 4.2.2 Install notedown Next, navigate to the RStudio Terminal and install notedown using pip3. This module converts markdown documents into .ipynb notebooks. pip3 install notedown Return to the RStudio Console. RStudio doesn’t automatically know where to look for notedown. Add the notedown installation to your RStudio PATH: # Add to PATH existing_path &lt;- Sys.getenv(&quot;PATH&quot;) notedown_path &lt;- &quot;/home/rstudio/.local/bin&quot; Sys.setenv(PATH = paste(existing_path, notedown_path, sep = &quot;:&quot;)) Confirm that notedown is ready to use: # Confirm notedown is accessible system2(&quot;notedown&quot;, &quot;--version&quot;) You should see the version number printed to the console: 4.3 Create Workspace Structure 4.3.1 Identify Your Repository You need a folder with content to get started. In the next step, this will be the basic structure of your files: AnVILPublishSkeleton |-DESCRIPTION |-LICENSE.md |-NAMESPACE |-README.md |-vignettes |-Notebook_1.Rmd “AnVILPublishSkeleton” is the name of the folder containing all of your information. The folder must contain a DESCRIPTION file, NAMESPACE file, and a vignettes directory with at least one .Rmd file. As you develop content, you might end up with many .Rmd notebooks inside the vignettes directory. We will practice with a basic set of files that are already set up for you on GitHub. First, you should clone the skeleton repository. git clone https://github.com/avahoffman/AnVILPublishSkeleton You’ll notice it contains a DESCRIPTION file, NAMESPACE file, and a vignettes directory with an .Rmd file. 4.3.2 Changing the DESCRIPTION File Edit the information in DESCRIPTION but keep the structure the same. Package: argument: This “package name” must match the name of the folder containing the DESCRIPTION and other files. In this case, it should be “AnVILPublishSkeleton”. Title: argument: This will become the header for your Workspace’s Dashboard. Authors@R: argument: Your author information and roles. At minimum, you should include a first name, family name, a role, and an email. You can add additional authors and roles as needed. See a more detailed guide to package metadata here. The most common roles are creator (cre), author (aut), and contributor (ctb), but there are many more to choose from if none of these fit the bill. Authors@R: person(given = &quot;Firstname&quot;, family = &quot;Lastname&quot;, role = &quot;cre&quot;, email = &quot;firstnamelastname@gmail.com&quot;) Description: argument: A several-sentence description of the project. 4.3.3 Changing Other Files Do not edit the NAMESPACE file. The README.md file and .Rmd file(s) will be discussed in more detail in Update Dashboard. 4.3.4 Create the Workspace Use the AnVILPublish::as_workspace() function. Replace &lt;billing-project&gt; with the appropriate Terra Billing Project of your choosing. Replace &lt;My-Workspace&gt; with the Workspace name of your choosing. AnVILPublish::as_workspace( path = &quot;/home/rstudio/AnVILPublishSkeleton&quot;, # directory containing DESCRIPTION file namespace = &quot;&lt;billing-project&gt;&quot;, # Billing project name = &quot;&lt;My-Workspace&gt;&quot;, # Actual Workspace name create = TRUE # Makes a *new* Workspace ) You will see output in the console as the function converts the .Rmd to .md. You might get some warning messages, but make sure that the Workspace was created without error: You should now see this new Workspace at https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces. 4.4 Update Dashboard Edit the README.md file to add more details to your Workspace Dashboard page. You will use the same function you used to create the Workspace as to update it, with a small change. Instead of create = TRUE you’ll now see an argument update = TRUE. Be very careful to use the correct Workspace name here, so you don’t accidentally overwrite the wrong Workspace. AnVILPublish::as_workspace( path = &quot;/home/rstudio/AnVILPublishSkeleton&quot;, # directory containing DESCRIPTION file namespace = &quot;&lt;billing-project&gt;&quot;, # Billing project name = &quot;&lt;My-Workspace&gt;&quot;, # Actual Workspace name update = TRUE, # Updates the Workspace with your changes use_readme = TRUE # Use README file for Dashboard Description ) You can also click the pencil button next to “ABOUT THE WORKSPACE” to edit the Dashboard manually, but these changes won’t show up later in GitHub. They will also be overwritten by other AnVILPublish updates. 4.5 Post Jupyter Notebook The .Rmd file contains your content. You can make many .Rmd files. These will get turned into .ipynb Jupyter Notebooks when you update using AnVILPublish. After you make changes to your .Rmd files, update the Workspace by running: AnVILPublish::as_workspace( path = &quot;/home/rstudio/AnVILPublishSkeleton&quot;, # directory containing DESCRIPTION file namespace = &quot;&lt;billing-project&gt;&quot;, # Billing project name = &quot;&lt;My-Workspace&gt;&quot;, # Actual Workspace name update = TRUE, # Updates the Workspace with your changes use_readme = TRUE # Use README file for Dashboard Description ) Note that this is the same code used to update the Workspace Dashboard. You can use this exact code to update your workspace any time you save changes in RStudio! 4.6 Push Changes to GitHub Hosting your course’s code on GitHub will ensure that it is reproducible, easy to update, and robust to any tweaks you make. After cloning the skeleton repository, you will need to make a few changes to ensure your content ends up associated with your GitHub account. This means you own it and can make/save changes! Briefly, you should: Create a new repository on GitHub. Don’t add a README.md, .gitignore, or license. Return to RStudio on AnVIL and Initialize your .Rproj. add and commit your changes on AnVIL. rename and add a new origin that points to the new repository you just created. push your changes. Remember that you will need to use a GitHub Personal Token instead of your password. Git can be challenging. Please reach out to our community network at help.anvilproject.org for help.

You will need to have a list of who will be taking your class, such as a course roster or sign-up list, as well as a list of additional instructors or teaching assistants. You can make changes later, so the list of students need not be final. 5.2 Identify Funding 5.2.1 NHGRI STRIDES Through the STRIDES program, NHGRI makes funding available to new users of the AnVIL, in collaboration with the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy. NHGRI currently supports the AnVIL Cloud Credits Program (AC2) and will have a second round of funding available in fall of 2021. 5.3 Collect Google IDs AnVIL IDs are based on Google accounts. Students – Contact students/participants to get their AnVIL IDs. These should be Gmail addresses or emails with GSuite capabilities. You can link students to Student Account Setup for instructions on what they should do. Co-instructors – If you will be working with other instructors, such as co-instructors or teaching assistants, you will need to collect their IDs as well. 5.4 Set Up Groups Reminder: Google Billing Accounts are managed on Google Cloud Platform and are used for organizing funding sources (e.g. credit cards, cloud credits). Terra Billing Projects are managed through Terra, and allow you to associate your Terra activity with the correct Google Billing Account. For a more detailed explanation, please see the chapter on Account Setup. We suggest creating two different Terra Billing Projects under the appropriate Billing Account that you created on cloud.google.com: one for students and one for co-instructors. The instructions below will walk you through how to set this up. Groups enable you to share your class Workspace and manage permissions for many people at once. We recommend starting with one Group for instructors and one Group for students. 5.4.1 Instructor Group Create an informative, unique Group name for any co-instructors and teaching assistants. We suggest a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-instructors”). Only letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes are allowed in Group names. To create a Group for instructors: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups Click “+ Create a New Group” Type in your instructor Group name Click “CREATE GROUP” You now have a unique instructor Group. 5.4.2 Add Instructors as “Admin” (Instructor Group) Now that your instructor Group has been created, you should add any additional instructors. You should also ensure that they have the correct permissions. Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the instructor Group name. This page should also be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add the instructor’s AnVIL ID. Type in the instructor’s AnVIL ID Make sure “Can manage users (admin)” is selected Click ADD USER. This will take you back to the Group administration page. Make sure the newly added instructor displays “Admin” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. Repeat this process for any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants. 5.4.3 Student Group Next, you will create a Group for your students. Create an informative, unique Group name. We suggest a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-students”). Only letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes are allowed in Group names. To create a Group for students: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups Click “+ Create a New Group” Type in your student Group name Click “CREATE GROUP” You now have a unique student Group. 5.4.4 Add Instructors as “Admin” (Student Group) The next steps ensure any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants are able to administer the student Group in case you are unavailable. Follow the steps below to add each co-instructor in the student Group: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the student Group name. This page should be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add the instructor’s AnVIL ID. Type in the instructor’s AnVIL ID Make sure “Can manage users (admin)” is selected Click ADD USER. This will take you back to the Group administration page. Make sure the newly added instructor displays “Admin” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. Repeat this process for any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants. 5.4.5 Add Students as “Member” Follow the steps below to add individual students to the student Group: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the student Group name. This page should be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add an AnVIL ID. Type in the student’s AnVIL ID Click ADD USER Make sure the newly added student displays “Member” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. At present, each student’s AnVIL ID must be added separately. Your instructor and student Groups are now set up. 5.4.6 Group Email Lists Note that your newly created Groups have Group emails associated with them. Take note of these Group emails. You will use them for granting access to your class Billing Projects and Workspaces in the next steps. 5.5 Set Up Billing Projects Billing Projects in Terra help organize your compute costs. Like Groups, we suggest creating two different billing projects under the appropriate Billing Account that you created on cloud.google.com: one for students and one for co-instructors. Billing Project names must be globally unique and cannot exceed 30 characters. 5.5.1 Instructor Billing Project First, create the Billing Project for instructors. We suggest the name of the Billing Project should be a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-instructors-bill-1”). To create a Billing Project for instructors: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “+CREATE” Type in your instructor Billing Project name Select the appropriate Billing Account Click “CREATE BILLING PROJECT” You now have a unique instructor Billing Project. 5.5.2 Add Instructors as “Owner” (Instructor Project) Next, you want to give instructors permission to use the Billing Project to compute. To set instructor permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made for instructors in Instructor Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the instructor Group name set up in Instructor Group. You should see an email in the form @firecloud.org (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors@firecloud.org). Ensure “Can manage users (Owner)” is selected Click “ADD USER” Your instructor Billing Project is now set up. 5.5.3 Student Billing Project Next, create a student Billing Project. Again, we suggest a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-students-bill-1”). To create a Billing Project for students: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “+CREATE” Type in your student Billing Project name Select the appropriate Billing Account (same as above) Click “CREATE BILLING PROJECT” You now have a unique student Billing Project. 5.5.4 Add Instructors as “Owner” (Student Project) You want to ensure any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants are able to administer the student Billing Project in case you are unavailable. To set instructor permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made for students in Student Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the instructor Group name set up in [### Set Up Groups]. You should see an email in the form @firecloud.org (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors@firecloud.org). Ensure “Can manage users (Owner)” is selected Click “ADD USER” This step makes it so that co-instructors can edit permissions and administer the student Billing Project as needed. While this means you and co-instructors can compute using the student Billing Project, this makes spending difficult to track. Instructors should always use the instructor Billing Project to compute. This makes it much easier to track costs associated with instructors versus students. 5.5.5 Add Students as “User” Next, you will add your student Group to the student Billing Project so that they can compute. To set student permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made for students in Student Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the student Group name set up in Student Group. You should see an email in the form @firecloud.org (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-students@firecloud.org). Keep “Can manage users (Owner)” deselected. Click “ADD USER” Your student Billing Project is now set up. 5.6 Set Permissions - Workspace Finally, you will want to set up permissions for co-instructors and students to see the class Workspace you created with the development Billing Project in Developing Content. AnVIL users can take on the “Owner”, “Writer”, or “Reader” role for a Workspace. 5.6.1 Add Instructors as “Owner” You should add your co-instructors and teaching assistants as “Owners” to the class Workspace. This is useful if they need to edit the course content or share the space with students on your behalf. To share and change permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces and find your class Workspace you set up in Developing Content Click the teardrop button for your class Workspace Click “Share”. This will open a dialog box. Enter the name of the instructor Group (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors). This will create a dropdown for the Group permissions in the box. Select this Group. Change permissions to “Owner” using the dropdown menu under the instructor Group Click “SAVE” This step makes it so that co-instructors can edit the original content of the Workspace as needed. While this means you and co-instructors can compute using the development Billing Project, this makes spending difficult to track. Instructors should instead clone the Workspace using the instructor Billing Project. This makes it much easier to track costs associated with this iteration of your class versus further iterations (e.g., the following semester or year). 5.6.2 Add Students as “Reader” Next, add your students as “Readers” to the class Workspace. This means they will be able to view and clone the Workspace, but not make edits or perform computations. To share the Workspace: Click the teardrop button for your class Workspace Click “Share”. This will open a dialog box. Enter the name of the student Group. This will create a dropdown for the Group permissions in the box. Select this Group. Ensure permissions are set to “Reader” (default) Click “SAVE” You have now correctly set up your class permissions! 5.7 Notify Terra Contacting Terra ahead of your class time helps the Terra team avoid any major disruptions to your class. Contact Terra by submitting a request for a hold on scheduled maintenance and downtime. It’s also a good idea to ask about major changes planned for the time prior to your class.

Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, so you’ll need a Google account to make sure your instructor can keep track of any computing costs you accrue. A.1 Step 1: Create a Google Account If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, create one now. Otherwise, please use a Gmail account you have already set up. If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow these instructions. A.2 Step 2: Sign in to Terra You need to sign into Terra with your Google account to allow your instructor to add you to projects and/or Workspaces associated with your specific class. This is the only way you can launch applications and perform computations on AnVIL. Launch Terra, and you should be prompted to sign in with your Google account. You can always access Terra by going to anvil.terra.bio, or by clicking the link on the AnVIL home page.
