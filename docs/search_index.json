AnVIL is NHGRI’s Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space. It provides a platform for performing genomic data analysis on the cloud. 1.2 Does AnVIL Cost Money? Through AnVIL, you pay for computing resources as you use them. If you’d like to try it out, new users can claim a $300 Google Cloud credit to test out the platform and perform some small analyses. We also provide a cost estimator. 1.3 Where Can I Get Help? Please visit our community support forum at help.anvilproject.org with any questions (or suggestions!) you may have. You can also visit the Getting Started Guide and anvilproject.org/learn for additional resources. 1.4 Activate scroll_highlight Feature Note that some sections of this book cover steps in a lot of detail. When navigating the table of contents, you can click subsection (e.g., 2.2, 4.2) headers a second time to expand the table of contents and enable the scroll_highlight feature.

You may be wondering if AnVIL is a good choice for your class. We feel the answer is an unequivocal YES. One of the greatest strength of AnVIL is that it provides version control of the program being used, so that you the instructor no longer have to devote time to solving issues caused by students using multiple operating systems or installing different versions of a program onto their computer. This also prevents unexpected run errors and limits the amount of troubleshooting you have to do. As a result, classes and activities will run more smoothly and predictably, allowing for an easier time with scheduling. Additionally, using AnVIL means that all students can participate in the activity without needing to provide computers that have certain specifications. Finally, AnVIL gives your students low-stress and low-stakes experience working with cloud-computing platforms, which is becoming common in today’s bioinformatics workplaces. 1.6 Goals for This Guide 1.7 Design Philosophy This guide provides an opinionated walkthrough on how to set up AnVIL for your class. These step-by-step instructions take instructors that are completely new to the AnVIL through account setup to the point where you can feel comfortable hosting a class from start-to-finish on AnVIL. Following the recommendations in this guide will help you minimize expenses, develop content programmatically, track individual student expenses, and stop billing expenses from accruing once the class is complete. In support of these goals we have made the following design decisions: ACCOUNT SETUP Sign up for a personal Google Cloud Account, where you can get started by claiming $300 free Google credits. CONTENT DEVELOPING Include version control and visibility of course content by using GitHub. This will allow you to add content programmatically, keep track of changes, and share your content with others outside of AnVIL. CLASS SETUP Create a separate Google Billing Account for each class. This will allow you to easily shut down expenses at the end of the class. Choose one funding source per class (for example, the STRIDES Program). Create separate Terra Billing Projects for each student. This will allow you to monitor billing expenses closely and work with students to build best computing practices. "],["before-you-start.html", "Chapter 2 Before You Start", " Chapter 2 Before You Start You will need a credit card or bank account to activate your free trial and get started. Don’t worry! You won’t be billed until you explicitly turn on automatic billing, but payment information is needed for verification purposes. Before setting up billing yourself, you may want to check with your institutional procurement office and see if they have a preferred account set-up method with Google (such as a third party reseller or an existing account). You can also work with your AnVIL collaborators or grant program officer to determine an appropriate Google Billing Account or Terra Billing Project for your class. "],["creating-an-instructor-account.html", "Chapter 3 Creating an instructor account 3.1 Create a Google Account 3.2 Sign in to Terra", " Chapter 3 Creating an instructor account AnVIL uses Terra to run analyses. Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, so you’ll pay for all storage and analysis costs through a Google account linked to Terra. The costs are the standard Google Cloud Platform fees for storing and moving data as well as executing an analysis. These costs are passed along through Terra without any markup. 3.1 Create a Google Account Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, so you will need a (free) Google account which will allow you to access the Terra platform to manage students and in-class analyses. Your Google account will also (1) allow you to manage billing yourself or (2) allow a Program Manager to do so on your behalf. If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, create one now. Otherwise, please use a Gmail account you have already set up. If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow these instructions. 3.2 Sign in to Terra You need to sign into Terra to allow Billing Project managers to add you to projects and/or Workspaces. Launch Terra, and you should be prompted to sign in with your Google account. You can always access Terra by going to anvil.terra.bio, or by clicking the link on the AnVIL home page. "],["creating-and-adding-student-accounts.html", "Chapter 4 Creating and adding student accounts 4.1 Have students create a Google Account 4.2 Have students sign in to Terra", " Chapter 4 Creating and adding student accounts Since Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, students need a Google account to make sure you can keep track of any computing costs they accrue. 4.1 Have students create a Google Account If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, create one now. Otherwise, please use a Gmail account you have already set up. If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow these instructions. 4.2 Have students sign in to Terra Students need to sign into Terra with their Google account to allow you the instructor to add them to projects and/or Workspaces associated with your specific class. This is the only way students can launch applications and perform computations on AnVIL. Have students launch Terra, and they should be prompted to sign in with your Google account. Collect Accounts: It is very important students share the Google account they used above with you! Otherwise, you cannot add them to billing projects, groups, or Workspaces.

We recommend starting with one Group for instructors and one Group for students. 5.1 Instructor Group Create an informative, unique Group name for any co-instructors and teaching assistants. We suggest a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-instructors”). Only letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes are allowed in Group names. To create a Group for instructors: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups Click “+ Create a New Group” Type in your instructor Group name Click “CREATE GROUP” You now have a unique instructor Group. 5.1.1 Add Instructors as “Admin” (Instructor Group) Now that your instructor Group has been created, you should add any additional instructors. You should also ensure that they have the correct permissions. Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the instructor Group name. This page should also be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add the instructor’s AnVIL ID. Type in the instructor’s AnVIL ID Make sure “Can manage users (admin)” is selected Click ADD USER. This will take you back to the Group administration page. Make sure the newly added instructor displays “Admin” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. Repeat this process for any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants. 5.2 Student Group Next, you will create a Group for your students. Create an informative, unique Group name. We suggest a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-students”). Only letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes are allowed in Group names. To create a Group for students: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups Click “+ Create a New Group” Type in your student Group name Click “CREATE GROUP” You now have a unique student Group. 5.2.1 Add Instructors as “Admin” (Student Group) The next steps ensure any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants are able to administer the student Group in case you are unavailable. Follow the steps below to add each co-instructor in the student Group: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the student Group name. This page should be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add the instructor’s AnVIL ID. Type in the instructor’s AnVIL ID Make sure “Can manage users (admin)” is selected Click ADD USER. This will take you back to the Group administration page. Make sure the newly added instructor displays “Admin” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. Repeat this process for any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants. 5.2.2 Add Students as “Member” Follow the steps below to add individual students to the student Group: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the student Group name. This page should be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add an AnVIL ID. Type in the student’s AnVIL ID Click ADD USER Make sure the newly added student displays “Member” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. At present, each student’s AnVIL ID must be added separately. Your instructor and student Groups are now set up. 5.3 Group Email Lists Note that your newly created Groups have Group emails associated with them. Take note of these Group emails. You will use them for granting access to your class Billing Projects and Workspaces. It saves you from having to add or revoke access to students one by one. * Set up a billing project for tracking costs * Add yourself and students to the billing project to grant permission to AnVIL resources * Learn about different sources of costs in AnVIL * Estimate costs for your class * Learn about how to track costs during your class 5.4 Creating a billing project First, create the Billing Project. Billing Project names must be globally unique and cannot exceed 30 characters. We suggest the name of the Billing Project should be a combination of institution-class- (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-bill-1”). To create a Billing Project: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “+CREATE” Type in your Billing Project name Select the appropriate Billing Account Click “CREATE BILLING PROJECT” You now have a unique Billing Project. 5.5 Adding Instructors as “Owner” Next, you want to give instructors permission to use the Billing Project to compute. To set instructor permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made in Instructor Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the instructor Group name set up in Instructor Group. You should see an email in the form @firecloud.org (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors@firecloud.org). Ensure “Can manage users (Owner)” is selected Click “ADD USER” This step makes it so that co-instructors can edit permissions and administer the Billing Project as needed. While this means you and co-instructors can compute using the student Billing Project, this makes spending difficult to track. Instructors should always use the instructor Workspace to compute. This makes it much easier to track costs associated with instructors versus students. 5.6 Adding Students as “User” Next, you will add your student Group to the Billing Project so that they can compute. To set student permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made in Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the student Group name set up in Student Group. You should see an email in the form @firecloud.org (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-students@firecloud.org). Keep “Can manage users (Owner)” deselected. Click “ADD USER” 5.7 Understanding the various billing costs Costs in AnVIL fall into one of three categories: compute costs, storage costs, and network usage (egress) costs. Compute costs are those that students accrue when actively using an AnVIL Workspace. Students can clone a Workspace for no cost, but they will begin to accrue costs as soon as they set up a cloud environment. Compute costs are based on how many CPUs you need, as well as how much memory and storage space you choose. You can also pause the Workspace and pay a lower cost per hour than if you were to keep the Workspace running. Current prices can be found here. Storage costs are driven by the persistent disk. The persistent disk allows you to store data and installed programs/libraries for a low cost. Students can delete their Workspaces but maintain their persistent disk so they still have access to previous programs they have installed and previous files they’ve created. Current prices can be found here. Finally, network usage costs are those involved with transferring data between networks or downloading data from the cloud to your local computer. Current prices can be found here. 5.8 Estimating costs before the class begins AnVIL has a free AnVIL_Cost_Estimator that allows you estimate compute, storage, and network usage costs for your class. This is a Google sheet that you can tailor to fit your needs. Before you use it, make sure the prices are up to date by following the links at the bottom of the sheet. If you need to create a Budget Justification for your class, you can also use the free AnVIL_Budget_Justification template. "],["how-much-does-a-class-cost.html", "Chapter 6 How much does a class cost? 6.1 Funding sources", " Chapter 6 How much does a class cost? One of the advantages of billing projects in Terra is that you can keep track of the costs during real time. You can see how much each Workspace is costing while your course is happening, so there are no unexpected surprises at the end! Full details about billing in Terra can be found here. These instructions are adapted from Terra Support. To view the costs being accrued by each billing project, you can go to https://console.cloud.google.com/billing. At the top of the page, there is a dropdown menu. Choose the billing project name you’d like to view. Once you are in proper billing project, you click on “View detailed charges” in the Billing section on the far right. This takes you to a report of the detailed charges accrued by the billing account. Here, you will be able to see the total cost over a time range, as well as costs broken down by services. 6.1 Funding sources NHGRI STRIDES {#strides-funding} Through the STRIDES program, NHGRI makes funding available to new users of the AnVIL, in collaboration with the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy. NHGRI currently supports the AnVIL Cloud Credits Program (AC2) and will have a second round of funding available in fall of 2021. "],["using-premade-content.html", "Chapter 7 Using premade content 7.1 Before You Start 7.2 Cloning the workspace", " Chapter 7 Using premade content This chapter will help you get started with the premade class activities available through AnVIL. Activities currently available are listed on the home page of this guide. Notify Terra Contacting Terra ahead of your class time helps the Terra team avoid any major disruptions to your class. Contact Terra by submitting a request for a hold on scheduled maintenance and downtime. It’s also a good idea to ask about major changes planned for the time prior to your class. 7.1 Before You Start You need to set up Billing. This includes your Google Billing Account and Terra Billing Project. Take note of your Terra Billing Project name. If you are running one of the activities that uses RStudio, you should launch RStudio using the Community-Maintained RStudio Environment. This requires you to be familiar with RStudio on AnVIL. Notify Terra. Contacting Terra ahead of your class time helps the Terra team avoid any major disruptions to your class. Contact Terra by submitting a request for a hold on scheduled maintenance and downtime. It’s also a good idea to ask about major changes planned for the time prior to your class. 7.2 Cloning the workspace Workspaces are the building blocks of projects in Terra. Inside a Workspace, you can run analyses, launch interactive tools like RStudio and Galaxy, store data, and share results. Cloning the workspace associated with one of the premade AnVIL activities gives you access to all the necessary data. When cloning, AnVIL makes a copy of notebooks and code for you to modify. Data however, is linked back to the original Workspace through Data Tables, which saves space! The video below gives a brief introduction to the parts of a Workspace. Launch Terra Locate the Workspace you want to clone. If a Workspace has been shared with you ahead of time, it will appear in “MY WORKSPACES”. You can clone a Workspace that was shared with you to perform your own analyses. In the screenshot below, no Workspaces have been shared. If a Workspace hasn’t been shared with you, navigate to the “FEATURED” or “PUBLIC” Workspace tabs. Use the search box to find the Workspace you want to clone. Click the teardrop button on the far right next to the Workspace you want to clone. Click “Clone”. You can also clone the Workspace from the Workspace Dashboard instead of the search results. You will see a popup box appear. Name your Workspace and select the appropriate Terra Billing Project. All activity in the Workspace will be charged to this Billing Project (regardless of who conducted it). Remember that each Workspace should have its own Billing Project. If you are working with protected data, you can set the Authorization Domain to limit who can be added to your Workspace. Note that the Authorization Domain cannot be changed after the Workspace is created (i.e. there is no way to make this Workspace shareable with a larger audience in the future). Workspaces by default are only visible to people you specifically share them with. Authorization domains add an extra layer of enforcement over privacy, but by nature make sharing more complicated. We recommend using Authorization Domains in cases where it is extremely important and/or legally required that the data be kept private (e.g. protected patient data, industry data). For data you would merely prefer not be shared with the world, we recommend relying on standard Workspace sharing permissions rather than Authorization Domains, as Authorization Domains can make future collaborations, publications, or other sharing complicated. Click “CLONE WORKSPACE”. The new Workspace should now show up under your Workspaces.

It’s also a good idea to ask about major changes planned for the time prior to your class. 8.0.1 Before You Start You need to set up Billing. This includes your Google Billing Account and Terra Billing Project. Take note of your Terra Billing Project name. Create your first Workspace. A first Workspace is needed to launch RStudio, but after that, all Workspaces can be made programmatically from within other Workspaces. Launch RStudio using the Community-Maintained RStudio Environment. This requires you to be familiar with RStudio on AnVIL. 8.1 Set Up AnVILPublish on AnVIL 8.1.1 Install AnVILPublish Install AnVIL and AnVILPublish. Don’t worry about loading it for now. Tip: hover over the top-right corner of the box below to copy the code. BiocManager::install(&quot;AnVIL&quot;) AnVIL::install(&quot;AnVILPublish&quot;) 8.1.2 Install notedown Next, navigate to the RStudio Terminal and install notedown using pip3. This module converts markdown documents into .ipynb notebooks. pip3 install notedown Return to the RStudio Console. RStudio doesn’t automatically know where to look for notedown. Add the notedown installation to your RStudio PATH: # Add to PATH existing_path &lt;- Sys.getenv(&quot;PATH&quot;) notedown_path &lt;- &quot;/home/rstudio/.local/bin&quot; Sys.setenv(PATH = paste(existing_path, notedown_path, sep = &quot;:&quot;)) Confirm that notedown is ready to use: # Confirm notedown is accessible system2(&quot;notedown&quot;, &quot;--version&quot;) You should see the version number printed to the console: 8.2 Create Workspace Structure 8.2.1 Identify Your Repository You need a folder with content to get started. In the next step, this will be the basic structure of your files: AnVILPublishSkeleton |-DESCRIPTION |-LICENSE.md |-NAMESPACE |-README.md |-vignettes |-Notebook_1.Rmd “AnVILPublishSkeleton” is the name of the folder containing all of your information. The folder must contain a DESCRIPTION file, NAMESPACE file, and a vignettes directory with at least one .Rmd file. As you develop content, you might end up with many .Rmd notebooks inside the vignettes directory. We will practice with a basic set of files that are already set up for you on GitHub. First, you should clone the skeleton repository. git clone https://github.com/avahoffman/AnVILPublishSkeleton You’ll notice it contains a DESCRIPTION file, NAMESPACE file, and a vignettes directory with an .Rmd file. 8.2.2 Changing the DESCRIPTION File Edit the information in DESCRIPTION but keep the structure the same. Package: argument: This “package name” must match the name of the folder containing the DESCRIPTION and other files. In this case, it should be “AnVILPublishSkeleton”. Title: argument: This will become the header for your Workspace’s Dashboard. Authors@R: argument: Your author information and roles. At minimum, you should include a first name, family name, a role, and an email. You can add additional authors and roles as needed. See a more detailed guide to package metadata here. The most common roles are creator (cre), author (aut), and contributor (ctb), but there are many more to choose from if none of these fit the bill. Authors@R: person(given = &quot;Firstname&quot;, family = &quot;Lastname&quot;, role = &quot;cre&quot;, email = &quot;firstnamelastname@gmail.com&quot;) Description: argument: A several-sentence description of the project. 8.2.3 Changing Other Files Do not edit the NAMESPACE file. The README.md file and .Rmd file(s) will be discussed in more detail in Update Dashboard. 8.2.4 Create the Workspace Use the AnVILPublish::as_workspace() function. Replace &lt;billing-project&gt; with the appropriate Terra Billing Project of your choosing. Replace &lt;My-Workspace&gt; with the Workspace name of your choosing. AnVILPublish::as_workspace( path = &quot;/home/rstudio/AnVILPublishSkeleton&quot;, # directory containing DESCRIPTION file namespace = &quot;&lt;billing-project&gt;&quot;, # Billing project name = &quot;&lt;My-Workspace&gt;&quot;, # Actual Workspace name create = TRUE # Makes a *new* Workspace ) You will see output in the console as the function converts the .Rmd to .md. You might get some warning messages, but make sure that the Workspace was created without error: You should now see this new Workspace at https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces. 8.3 Set Workspace permissions Finally, you will want to set up permissions for co-instructors and students to see the class Workspace you created with the development Billing Project in Developing Content. AnVIL users can take on the “Owner”, “Writer”, or “Reader” role for a Workspace. 8.3.1 Add Instructors as “Owner” You should add your co-instructors and teaching assistants as “Owners” to the class Workspace. This is useful if they need to edit the course content or share the space with students on your behalf. To share and change permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces and find your class Workspace you set up in Developing Content Click the teardrop button for your class Workspace Click “Share”. This will open a dialog box. Enter the name of the instructor Group (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors). This will create a dropdown for the Group permissions in the box. Select this Group. Change permissions to “Owner” using the dropdown menu under the instructor Group Click “SAVE” This step makes it so that co-instructors can edit the original content of the Workspace as needed. While this means you and co-instructors can compute using the development Billing Project, this makes spending difficult to track. Instructors should instead clone the Workspace using the instructor Billing Project. This makes it much easier to track costs associated with this iteration of your class versus further iterations (e.g., the following semester or year). 8.3.2 Add Students as “Reader” Next, add your students as “Readers” to the class Workspace. This means they will be able to view and clone the Workspace, but not make edits or perform computations. To share the Workspace: Click the teardrop button for your class Workspace Click “Share”. This will open a dialog box. Enter the name of the student Group. This will create a dropdown for the Group permissions in the box. Select this Group. Ensure permissions are set to “Reader” (default) Click “SAVE” You have now correctly set up your class permissions! 8.4 Update Dashboard Edit the README.md file to add more details to your Workspace Dashboard page. You will use the same function you used to create the Workspace as to update it, with a small change. Instead of create = TRUE you’ll now see an argument update = TRUE. Be very careful to use the correct Workspace name here, so you don’t accidentally overwrite the wrong Workspace. AnVILPublish::as_workspace( path = &quot;/home/rstudio/AnVILPublishSkeleton&quot;, # directory containing DESCRIPTION file namespace = &quot;&lt;billing-project&gt;&quot;, # Billing project name = &quot;&lt;My-Workspace&gt;&quot;, # Actual Workspace name update = TRUE, # Updates the Workspace with your changes use_readme = TRUE # Use README file for Dashboard Description ) You can also click the pencil button next to “ABOUT THE WORKSPACE” to edit the Dashboard manually, but these changes won’t show up later in GitHub. They will also be overwritten by other AnVILPublish updates. 8.5 Post Jupyter Notebook The .Rmd file contains your content. You can make many .Rmd files. These will get turned into .ipynb Jupyter Notebooks when you update using AnVILPublish. After you make changes to your .Rmd files, update the Workspace by running: AnVILPublish::as_workspace( path = &quot;/home/rstudio/AnVILPublishSkeleton&quot;, # directory containing DESCRIPTION file namespace = &quot;&lt;billing-project&gt;&quot;, # Billing project name = &quot;&lt;My-Workspace&gt;&quot;, # Actual Workspace name update = TRUE, # Updates the Workspace with your changes use_readme = TRUE # Use README file for Dashboard Description ) Note that this is the same code used to update the Workspace Dashboard. You can use this exact code to update your workspace any time you save changes in RStudio! 8.6 Push Changes to GitHub Hosting your course’s code on GitHub will ensure that it is reproducible, easy to update, and robust to any tweaks you make. After cloning the skeleton repository, you will need to make a few changes to ensure your content ends up associated with your GitHub account. This means you own it and can make/save changes! Briefly, you should: Create a new repository on GitHub. Don’t add a README.md, .gitignore, or license. Return to RStudio on AnVIL and Initialize your .Rproj. add and commit your changes on AnVIL. rename and add a new origin that points to the new repository you just created. push your changes.
